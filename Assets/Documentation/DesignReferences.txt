Design Notes:
	Stage:
		- Background
			- Should  be relatively plain and have low saturation colors to ensure it doesn't distract the player from the platform and traps.
		- Stage itself:
			- Platforms should have a clear silhouette, try and reduce foreground objects.
	
	Characters:
		- Base: Refer to Junkrat from Overwatch and start from there!
			- Somewhat batshit insane, but not insane to the point of not knowing how to swing that hook!
		- Variation: Cold and calculating guy
		- Variation: Someone swinging for the heck of it.
		
		- All characters should have the same abilities.
		
	- Modes:
		- The basic mode will based around Ultimate Chicken Horse's (UCH) Party mode, players take turns deploying traps and attempting to reach a goal through them!

UI:
	- Selection Auras
	- 
	
UX: 
	- Background response to keep the user interested even if they aren't directly interacting with the game.
		- For example, clouds moving in the background keeps the world alive.

	- General checklist:
		- Squash and stretch
		- Particle effects (Your gun needs explosions!)
		- Still frames (When you hit something, should the game stop to let you evaluate what just happened?)
		- Animations (Should your character do a sick spin while doing a perfect grapple jump?)
	
	Events: 
		- Responses (When you hit something, another thing should happen!)
			- Still Frames
			- Particle Effects
			- What if it's a "failed" response, such as grapple failure?

	- Player Movement:
		- Grappling hook shouldn't be rigid.
		- Grappling hook should be a fired projectile
	
	- Landing on grass should release leaves, for example.
		- No, not just leaves, leaves the move in your direction, oh yes, wait, how do people implement that?

Please reference other platformers for feedback effects:
