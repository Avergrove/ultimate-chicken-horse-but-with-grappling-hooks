Design Notes:
	Stage:
		- Background
			- Should  be relatively plain and have low saturation colors to ensure it doesn't distract the player from the platform and traps.
		- Stage itself:
			- Platforms should have a clear silhouette, try and reduce foreground objects.
	
	Characters:
		- Base: Refer to Junkrat from Overwatch and start from there!
			- Somewhat batshit insane, but not insane to the point of not knowing how to swing that hook!
		- Variation: Cold and calculating guy
		- Variation: Someone swinging for the heck of it.
		
		- All characters should have the same abilities.
		
	- Modes:
		- The basic mode will based around Ultimate Chicken Horse's (UCH) Party mode, players take turns deploying traps and attempting to reach a goal through them!
