STUFF:
	2) Implement a reload and fire system, which should help mitigate the problem of the player having too much control of the environment.
	3) Implement tiles that CANT be hooked on, or tiles in its path that destroys the hook projectile
	5) Projectile should fly faster or slower relative to the player's speed, this allows the player to latch ahead even if they are faster than the projectile.
	6) Implement a basic stage. Essential elements include:
		- Latch ropes (Latchable objects you can't stand on)
		- One-way platforms
		
	7) Secondary fire that allows that player to slow down in the air and slingshot themselves forward
	
	8) Interactable environments
		- Objects you can pull with your grappling hook
		- Pickups that change the stage layout
		- One-time latchers
		- Moving platforms
	
	9) Stage variety
		- Extra mechanics:
			- Wind
			- Gravity
			- "Enemies"
			- Rhythm stages
			
		
		- Challenge areas
			- 
			
		- "Niche" mechanics
			- Wall climbing

		- Layout:
			- Linear: Just go from start to end!
			- Pickup: Pick up a colletion of items to move forward
			- Vertical vs Horizontal: Or even Diagonal!
			- Misc: Staircase, zig-zag
			- Try and mix up the layout between rooms  
		
		- Try keeping levels to 15-20 rooms
		- You don't have to oversaturate stages with mechanics, you just have to introduce a few and challenge them towards the end!
			- In particular, mixing mechanics together towards the end
		
		- Reference: Megaman rooms, using hallways to force players to react appropriately
		
		
	10)- Power ups / Pick ups
			- Instantaneous grappling
			- Infinite grappling
			- Multiple hooks
			- Hook Refill


	11) Enemies:
			- The grappling hook can also act as a weapon to destroy enemies. Players should fire responsibly to avoid an accidental hook to their death!

UX:
	1) Implement a more satisfying death
	2) Implement camera shake
	4) Add placeholder music
	
Bugs:
	1) Player character stutters at max speed 
		- Check whether it's a render stutter or a velocity stutter!
	2) You can rapple into the ground
		- Fix it by makign sure you can't rappel while "on the ground"
	3) Jump shouldn't function when you're dying.
		- or maybe....
	4) Grapple projectile shouldn't be able to be fired again
	5) The anchor should move along with a moving platform.
	6) The player should move along the moving platform
		- Because thesse 2 problems involve the moving platform, it's a good idea to figure out how to work with parenting objects with platforms.
	
Refactoring:
	x) Is there a way to use the tile palette to deploy prefabs?
	3) Move the kill code somewhere else. Maybe even have an IKillable interface.
	
Joke ideas:
	1) A pub called Super Idle where you ... wait for a reward while a familliar tone plays...
