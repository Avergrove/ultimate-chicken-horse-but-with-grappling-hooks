STUFF:
	1) Convert your hook into a projectile
	2) Implement a reload and fire system, which should help mitigate the problem of the player having too much control of the environment.
	3) Implement tiles that CANT be hooked on, or tiles in its path that destroys the hook projectile

Fun factor:
	1) The game is not very exciting when there's nothing to latch on on a long path, there are two options:
		- Don't have long paths
		- Let players grapple onto the floor to speed boost somehow
			- Which involves creating an elastic grappling hook
			- What if there's a secondary fire meant for ground based movement? This summons a nail so that the player moves forward instead of being pulled across the floor
				- Check Knuckles' Chaotix tethers, instead of having a second player, you can get the player to fire a heavy tether which hurls them forwards, usable anywhere!
	
UX:
	1) Implement a more satisfying death
	2) Implement camera shake
	3) Add sound effects
	4) Add placeholder music
	
Bugs:
	1) Player character stutters at max speed 
		- Check whether it's a render stutter or a velocity stutter!
	
Refactoring:
	1) Is there a way to use the tile palette to deploy prefabs?
	2) Move the kill code somewhere else. Maybe even have an IKillable interface.
	3) PlayerMovement has too much responsibility, it handles physics, logics, and UX.
