STUFF:
	x) Convert your hook into a projectile
	2) Implement a reload and fire system, which should help mitigate the problem of the player having too much control of the environment.
	3) Implement tiles that CANT be hooked on, or tiles in its path that destroys the hook projectile
	x) Rope length should scale to how far it travelled, also it should be clamped.
	5) Projectile should fly faster or slower relative to the player's speed, this allows the player to latch ahead even if they are faster than the projectile.
	6) Implement a basic stage. Essential elements include:
		- Latch ropes (Latchable objects you can't stand on)
		- One-way platforms
		
			
	7) Secondary fire that allows that player to slow down in the air and slingshot themselves forward
	
	8) Interactable environments
		- Objects you can pull with your grappling hook
		- Pickups that change the stage layout
		- One-time latchers
		- Moving platforms
	
	9) Stage variety
		- Extra mechanics:
			- Wind
			- Gravity
			- "Enemies"
			- Rhythm stages
		
		- Challenge areas
			- 
			
		- "Niche" mechanics
			- Wall climbing

		- Layout:
			- Linear: Just go from start to end!
			- Pickup: Pick up a colletion of items to move forward
			- Vertical vs Horizontal: Or even Diagonal!
		
	10)- Power ups / Pick ups
			- Instantaneous grappling
			- Infinite grappling
			- Multiple hooks
			- Hook Refill

UX:
	1) Implement a more satisfying death
	2) Implement camera shake
	4) Add placeholder music
	
Bugs:
	1) Player character stutters at max speed 
		- Check whether it's a render stutter or a velocity stutter!
	
Refactoring:
	x) You should spawn an anchor instead of moving an existing one on the scene
	2) Is there a way to use the tile palette to deploy prefabs?
	3) Move the kill code somewhere else. Maybe even have an IKillable interface.
